Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 


Let me introduce myself. 


I'm Omar Darwesh.


I'm a Computer Science postgraduate with an analytical mindset and enthusiasm for **Data Analysis**, **Analytics Engineering**, and **Data Engineering**.

On a typical day, I worked on developing deliverables such as presentations, dashboards, and reports using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **PowerPoint**, **Figma**, and others as needed.

My workflow usually started with exploring and understanding the dataâ€”assessing its quality, identifying any issues, and defining suitable approaches to address them. Once the data challenges were tackled and multiple sources were integrated where necessary, I moved on to the design phase.

I began by sketching and shaping the structure of dashboards and reports, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also informative and purposeful. From there, I built comprehensive dashboards that clearly presented **KPIs** and performance metrics aligned with business objectives.

A key focus throughout was making insights easily understandable for **non-technical stakeholders**, so that data-driven decisions could be made with clarity and confidence.

In Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab & VS Code,

|:--:|:--:|:--:|

I used **SQL**, **Python**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets** for Exploring and Cleaning data existing in files like CSVs and databases like Microsoft SQL Server & MySQL.

I experienced different visualization tools like **Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, and Python**.

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Power BI | Tableau | Looker Studio | Python |



I used **Power BI** to build these interactive reports and dashboards:

A few examples of the type of visualizations I created are like these:

![Progress Overview](assets/project-pics/maji-ndogo-pics/progress--overview.png)




I know what you're thinking right now. You wanna see a couple of interactive dashboard/report samples.

Have a look at a few Reports/Dashboards for interactive insights I made with Power BI:
