On a typical day, I worked on developing deliverables such as presentations, dashboards, and reports using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Google Sheets**, **PowerPoint**, **Figma**, and others as needed.

My workflow usually started with exploring and understanding the dataâ€”assessing its quality, identifying any issues, and defining suitable approaches to address them. Once the data challenges were tackled and multiple sources were integrated where necessary, I moved on to the design phase.

I began by sketching and shaping the structure of dashboards and reports, ensuring they were not only visually appealing but also informative and purposeful. From there, I built comprehensive dashboards that clearly presented **KPIs** and performance metrics aligned with business objectives.

A key focus throughout was making insights easily understandable for **non-technical stakeholders**, so that data-driven decisions could be made with clarity and confidence.
